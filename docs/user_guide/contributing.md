# Contributing

!!! note
	We need testers and feedback! Don't hesitate to reach out and give us your opinion, ideas for improvement, and to [open issues](https://github.com/Inria-NERV/happyFeat/issues) for bugs or missing features!

Contributions to HappyFeat are possible in multiple ways:

- **HIGHLY ENCOURAGED!** For bugfixes, additional features, etc. you can [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/Inria-NERV/happyFeat/issues).

- if you're brave and confident enough, you can contribute to the source code to add/improve mechanisms, or to add pipelines. You will need to create a fork of the repository, create a new branch from the top of the official `main` branch, and open an issue and a pull-request.

- a "developer/contributer guide" will be uploaded in the near future. Stay tuned...
